The given code is from the archived mbrl-lib repository: https://github.com/facebookresearch/mbrl-lib

The original code is adapted for the continuous Cart Pole and Inverted Pendulum environments. I added reward and termination functions for the continuous Cart Pole, continuous Lunar Lander, continuous Mountain Car, Pendulum, MuJoCo Reacher, and Panda Gym Reach (dense and sparse rewards) environments.
